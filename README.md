# Machine-Learning-Internship-Tasks-Skillcraft-Technology
This repository contains multiple Machine Learning projects developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Each project focuses on a different ML technique and demonstrates the complete workflow, including data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

These projects are suitable for learning, practice, and portfolio purposes.

Project Files Description
1. SCT_ML_1 – House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised learning (regression) techniques.

Key Concepts Covered:

Understanding and exploring the housing dataset

Handling missing values and feature selection

Data preprocessing and normalization

Building regression models to predict house prices

Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics

Outcome:
The model learns the relationship between various house features (such as size, location-related factors, etc.) and predicts the expected house price.

2. SCT_ML_2 – Mall Customer Dataset Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques.

Key Concepts Covered:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer data

Visualization of customer behavior patterns

Feature selection for clustering

Applying clustering algorithms (such as K-Means)

Interpreting clusters to understand different customer groups

Outcome:
Customers are grouped into meaningful segments based on their spending behavior and income, helping businesses understand and target different customer types effectively.

3. SCT_ML_3 – Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks.

Key Concepts Covered:

Introduction to SVM and margin-based classification

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Training an SVM classifier

Hyperparameter tuning (kernel selection, C, gamma)

Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

Outcome:
The SVM model successfully classifies data points into different classes with optimized decision boundaries.

Purpose of the Repository

The main goal of this repository is to strengthen machine learning fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets. These projects can be used for academic submissions, internships, or as part of a personal ML portfolio.

4. SCT_ML_4 - Developed a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
   Project: Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN

Objective:

Recognize and classify hand gestures from images or live video.

Can be used for gesture-controlled applications, e.g., sign language recognition or touchless interfaces.

Dataset:

LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle

10 gesture classes: c, down, fist, fist_moved, index, l, ok, palm, palm_moved, thumb

~20,000 images, split 80% training / 20% validation

Technology Stack:

Python & Google Colab

Kaggle API – download dataset

TensorFlow & Keras – build/train CNN

OpenCV – capture webcam input and predict gestures in real-time

CNN Architecture: 3 Conv2D + MaxPooling layers → Flatten → Dense layers → Output softmax for 10 classes

Workflow:

Download dataset and reorganize images

Preprocess images (resize, normalize)

Build and train CNN

Save model (.h5 and .keras)

Use webcam or uploaded images for real-time gesture prediction

Outcome:

High accuracy on validation (~99.98%)

Real-time prediction works via webcam or static image upload
